# An-Empirical-Analysis-of-Volatility-in-China-s-Green-Bond-Market

With the worldwide increasing concern of environmental problems, green bond is designed as a new source to help finance green and sustainable projects. This thesis is intended to quantify the volatility pattern of the Chinese green bond market and examine whether there exists long-term or short-term volatility transformation between the Chinese green bond market and the Chinese stock market/conventional (traditional) bond market applying the DCC-GARCH model. It's found that the volatility of the Chinese green bond market is driven by its own "experience", and there exists a long-term volatility transformation phenomenon among the Chinese green bond market and the other two benchmark markets. Also, the relatively small optimal hedge ratio between the green bond market and the equity market indicates that the green bond market lacks sufficient hedging protection capability against the equity market. The results provided in this thesis might give investors some insights into this emerging but promising market, which might also have implications for portfolio optimization and risk management from the perspective of hedging.![image](https://github.com/BoyuanChen0104/An-Empirical-Analysis-of-Volatility-in-China-s-Green-Bond-Market/assets/140489778/31f69dad-3048-42c3-8fa7-8ac4277ed93e)
